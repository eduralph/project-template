# 14. Threat model

> Living document. What is worth attacking, where the trust boundaries are, who the
> adversaries are, and which attacks {{PROJECT_NAME}} must withstand, each mapped to what
> mitigates it and the test that checks it. Open questions are marked **[OPEN]** inline.

> **How to fill this in:** start small and grow it as surfaces are built; a threat model is
> never complete. Fill §14.1–§14.3 first, before code exists. Add §14.4–§14.7 as each trust
> boundary appears in code. A change that adds an untrusted input or moves a trust boundary
> updates this section in the same PR, and the short summary in
> `.oss-scanner/threat_model.md` with it. Replace each italic prompt and delete this block
> once the first three subsections are written. Example:
> [wyrd](https://github.com/getwyrd/wyrd/blob/main/docs/design/architecture/14-threat-model.md).

## 14.1 Assets

_What is worth protecting: data, keys, availability, integrity of results. For each, what
losing it means for users._

## 14.2 Trust boundaries

_Where data or control crosses from less trusted to more trusted: network inputs, files from
users, plugins, other services. A diagram in `diagrams/` helps._

## 14.3 Adversaries

_Who might attack and what they can already do: an anonymous network user, an authenticated
user, a compromised dependency, an operator with too much access._

## 14.4 STRIDE, per boundary

_For each boundary in §14.2: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure,
denial of service, elevation of privilege. Only the ones that apply._

## 14.5 Attack catalog

_The concrete attacks this kind of system must withstand, each with the decision (ADR) or
mechanism that mitigates it._

## 14.6 Abuse-case tests

_Tests that play the attacker: malformed input, replay, resource exhaustion, privilege
probing._

## 14.7 Threat → test map

_A table: threat, mitigation, the test that proves it. A threat without a test is a gap
(§14.9)._

## 14.8 Residual and accepted risks

_What is not mitigated, why that is acceptable, and who accepted it._

## 14.9 Gaps and their disposition

_Known gaps, each with an issue or milestone that closes it._
