# Move cargo-deny's advisory database to the commit the .github/advisory-db submodule pins,
# so the gate audits a fixed database:
#
#   scripts/advisory-db.sh && cargo deny --offline check advisories
#
# A newly published advisory then reaches the gate only through Dependabot's daily PR that
# moves the pin, instead of turning every open PR red at once. Only the submodule's commit
# is read; nothing checks the submodule out. deny.toml keeps the database in
# target/advisory-dbs (db-path), so this never rewinds the shared copy in $CARGO_HOME.
#
# It also runs `cargo fetch --locked`, because --offline stops cargo-deny downloading
# crates too. To audit against the newest database instead, run plain
# `cargo deny check advisories`: .github/workflows/advisories.yml does that daily, and a
# release should do it before building.
